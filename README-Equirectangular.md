## Streetview Equirectangular
Streetview Equirectangular
This code is forked from https://github.com/notlion/streetview-stereographic
Changed by Clement Shimizu
--------------------------
The purpose of this code is to create a simple to use html interface for loading streetview as equirectangular view.
If you are intrested in this code you will likely perfer the orginal source better. This code is simply a feature limited version of the original source and will not be maintained as regularly as the original.

To use this, please load equirectangular.html in the browser.  The first time you load, the url will change.  You can then set p=lat,long in the url to be the desired location.

Ignore O, and MZ as these are for the stereographic view that is no longer used.
